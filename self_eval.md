# Self Evaluation

<!-- 1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It's useful to use conditional in code to make sure that the user will be pointed in the right direction, This is used in multiple apps if you aren't old enough to go into the site or if you get a patient at a hospital you would want them to go to the right ward and get the help they need. Conditionals are a great way to help the user go into the right direction and use the app or website to get the help or info that they need. -->

<!-- 1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
What I would do differently in this assignment is get a better understanding of the code, being able to shorten it down to make it straight forward with all the information still being proccessed without writing out more code then what is needed for making it more organized and making it easy to see where errors will occur with the ability to be fixed. -->
<!-- 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
The most staisfaction i recieved today is how I worked, I took breaks to not get overwhelmed and comeback to look and study different ways to do code to make it more efficient plus learning different structures to make the code easily readable but I still have a long way to go. -->
